# ansible-scripts
This repository contains Ansible scripts designed to automate two primary tasks: creating snapshots and installing an Apache web server. These scripts are aimed at simplifying and expediting the process of deploying and managing an Apache web server, as well as providing an efficient solution for snapshot management.

# Objectives
Snapshot Automation: The included Ansible scripts facilitate automatic snapshot creation. Snapshots provide a quick and easy way to back up the current state of the system, making restoration straightforward when needed.

Apache Installation: Deployment of an Apache web server is also automated using the provided Ansible scripts. This automation ensures consistent and swift installation, thereby reducing potential errors.

# Features
Snapshot Management: The scripts provide functionalities to create, list, and delete snapshots, providing full control over system backups.

Apache Deployment: Apache installation is handled automatically, ensuring the server is configured according to best practices and ready for use.

# Prerequisites
Before running the Ansible scripts, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

An infrastructure compatible with Ansible.
Administrative access to the target machines.
SSH access configured between the host running the Ansible scripts and the target machines.
Usage
Configuration: Modify the Ansible configuration files as per your requirements, especially the IP addresses of the target machines and SSH certificate paths.

Execution: Run the Ansible scripts using the ansible-playbook command and specify the appropriate playbook for the task you wish to accomplish. For example:

  ansible-playbook create_snapshots.yml

  ansible-playbook install_apache.yml

Customization: Add additional tasks or modify the scripts according to your specific needs. The scripts are designed to be easily modifiable and extensible.
